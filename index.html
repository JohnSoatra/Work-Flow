          <span class="starter">My</span> name is Soatra. I am a new software developer. Anyway, I'm not a professional developer. However, I really like technology and developing.
          I have started studying many years ago and I also know many languages as well such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, ...
          I have a lot of practice in developing, I have ever tried to build websites from scratch on my own also tried to create applications with a lot of researches by myself too. <br><br>
          <span class="starter">The</span> reason why I love to study is that studying always gives me something new and interesting.
          I love to study because the study makes me feel excited.
          With my studying and practice, I've done so much work and created many things and I would like to show you about them as well:
